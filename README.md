# python-adventure-game
Eventually, this game will be a text-based adventure game written in Python. It currently is those things except that the story is far from finished. Nothing present currently is final.

For developers: If you make a change to an item, creature, location, or the player, make sure to restart the game by deleting the save file. Otherwise, the changes will not be reflected.
